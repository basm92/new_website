### My PhD Thesis

My PhD Thesis is available in two parts. First, the actual thesis, which is downloadable via [this link](http://bas-m.netlify.app/phd_thesis.pdf).

### Replication Package

The main thesis is accompanied by a replication package, which can be found [here](https://github.com/basm92/replication_packages). The purpose of this package is to share shareable data, but also to make my findings reproducible by showing the code that lead to the results in each table.
