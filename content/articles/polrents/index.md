title: Returns to Politics Under A Changing Political System
---

### Abstract

Economists frequently assert that politicians derive financial returns from a political career, but it is unclear what allows them to do so. In this paper, I derive estimates of the returns to consecutive Lower House mandates exploiting the repeated treatment assignment resulting from Dutch district-level elections (1860-1917). Based on newly-collected data from probate inventories, I obtain a measure of personal wealth for a sample of just-elected politicians and their losing contenders. Using a dynamic regression discontinuity methodology, I document that politicians' returns to politics are concentrated in the first period of political activity. The results show that politicians who were elected once accumulated wealth with a rate that is about 5 percentage points per annum higher than their nearly-elected counterparts. I also investigate the role of political parties in constraining politicians' ability to benefit financially from their political career. I find that after the establishment of political parties, there is only limited evidence of politicians being able to profit from their political career, suggesting political parties discipline politicians' in-office behavior.
