title: Democratization, Personal Wealth of Politicians and Voting Behavior

### Abstract


From about 1850 to 1920, a wave of democratization and liberalization swept over Western Europe, bringing about universal suffrage and an expansion of government. Using newly-collected probate inventories that provide a measure of politicians' personal wealth, this paper investigates the role of personal wealth in this process illustrated by the case of the Netherlands. I show that parliaments became significantly less wealthy over time. I then analyze voting behavior of politicians on several laws extending the franchise and increasing taxes. I find that richer politicians were more likely to vote against fiscal legislation. The findings indicate that the personal wealth of politicians negatively influenced the probability of increasing taxes, and played an important role in determining government size. My analyses support a causal interpretation of these results. In contrast, I find no convincing relationship between politicians' personal wealth and their voting behavior on suffrage extensions.
