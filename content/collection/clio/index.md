Clio is an R package that serves as a bridge between the user and the website [Clio Infra](http://clio-infra.eu), a repository containing publicly available data on various aspects of economic history at the country level. This package is designed to quickly and efficiently extract data, allowing the user to make large queries. This way, the user is not confined to manually downloading Excel files, and the associated filtering and merging process. The package also facilitates transparent and reproducible data collection, and it is ‘typo robust’ to a certain extent, to prevent annoyance.
