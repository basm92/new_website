description: I am an Assistant Professor in Applied Economics at Utrecht University, specializing in economic history and political economy. My research combines archival research, econometric methods, historical insights and economic theory to investigate the influence of personal wealth on the voting behavior of the Dutch political elite in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It also focuses on the financial returns to politics, and drivers of democratization of the Netherlands.
