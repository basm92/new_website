description: I am a PhD Candidate at Utrecht University specializing in Economic History . My PhD research attempts to combine archival research, econometric methods, historical insights and economic theory to investigate the influence of personal wealth on the voting behavior of the Dutch political elite in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It also focuses on the personal financial returns to politics, and the drivers of democratization of the Netherlands.
