## Radio Broadcast

I was invited to the Dutch radio program _Spraakmakers_ to talk about my PhD thesis. You can listen to the recording [here](https://www.nporadio1.nl/uitzendingen/spraakmakers/b69eed99-56a6-4525-af1f-7695adcf93ba/2023-01-20-spraakmakers). The part where I show up is roughly from 1:11:25 to 1:27:00. I am discussing with political historian Remieg Aerts and presenter Carl-Johan de Zwart about the Dutch political system in the 19th century in light of the findings in my PhD dissertation.
