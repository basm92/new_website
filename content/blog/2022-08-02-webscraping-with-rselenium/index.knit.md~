## Introduction

In this blogpost, I want to tell you about web scraping using `RSelenium`, something which I've recently been learning and which I am very enthusiastic about, because it is very powerful.

So I went to [the official English-language website](https://en.parliran.ir/eng/en/10th%20Term) of the Iranian parliament, and looked up the list of members. 

Naturally, I wanted to scrape all of these names. For those of you familiar with scraping, a first approach would be something like the following. For those who aren't, I have another nice blog post about elementary web scraping, but maybe you can follow along!
