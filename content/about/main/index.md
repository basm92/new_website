  My PhD research attempts to combine archival research, econometric methods, historical insights and economic theory to investigate the influence of personal wealth on the voting behavior of the Dutch political elite in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It also focuses on the personal financial returns to politics, and the drivers of democratization of the Netherlands. 
  
  In addition, I work on the effects of workersâ€™ mobilization on politicians and electorates in the Netherlands, the dynamics of wealth and inequality in the Netherlands, and I investigate the long-term effects of Dutch firms in Indonesia. I also work part-time at Erasmus University (the Netherlands), where I supervise theses in various areas of Finance.
  
  ### Research Interests

  My research interests encompass economic history, political economy and institutional economics. I also love methodology, data science, deep learning, statistics, programming and web design. Over time, I created and maintain a number of R packages, which you can access here.
  
  ### This website

  This website shows some of my present work, and serves as a pathway to several data repositories and guides that I have written. It will also serve as an access point to Course Material that I provide. I write a blog post every once in a while, about things that interest me. Sometimes, these posts are more of a reminder to myself about how to do something. I guess these will be mostly data-related, but feel free to browse around for anything. Some of the more recent posts are shown below.
