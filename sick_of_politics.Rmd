# Short Summary

## Short Summary

- The paper uncovers the causal effect of political office on (i) income, (ii) general health, and (iii) mental health
  - Political office: being appointed (!) as a mayor, or being elected into the national Norwegian parliament
  
- Study uses administrative data on public health service usage

# Discussion Plan

## Discussion Points

- Is the treatment the right treatment? 
  - More refined ways of gauging the mental-health related impact of politics? 

- Is the control group the right control group? 

- Reasons for a null effect? 
  - Mitigating effect of income?
  
## More Refined Ways of Gauging Mental-Health Impact

- Naively, we might assume that political sentiment is random and orthogonal to the actions and potential outcomes of politicians
- In that case, start with the media hits for candidate $i$ 
  - Naively, perform sentiment analysis on each article associated with the candidate
  
  - Two potential treatment effects: one of the campaign (pre-election period) against (in favor of) the candidate
  - And one of the ex-post media attention
  
- Counterfactual: media attention of non-appointed candidates

## More Refined Ways

- NLP-based approach:
  - Manually classify articles as "good" or "bad" 

- Use e.g. random forest to classify the remaining articles on the basis of:
  - e.g. a document-term matrix 
  - Embeddings of the text in a language model (Ash & Hansen, 2023)
  
- Use the relationship between media sentiment and mental health in the control group to assess what would have happened to the treatment group if they hadn't received the treatment
