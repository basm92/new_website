      <description>Abstract Economists frequently assert that politicians derive financial returns from a political career, but it is unclear what allows them to do so. In this paper, I derive estimates of the returns to consecutive Lower House mandates exploiting the repeated treatment assignment resulting from Dutch district-level elections (1860-1917). Based on newly-collected data from probate inventories, I obtain a measure of personal wealth for a sample of just-elected politicians and their losing contenders.</description>

      <description>Abstract From about 1850 to 1920, a wave of democratization and liberalization swept over Western Europe, bringing about universal suffrage and an expansion of government. Using newly-collected probate inventories that provide a measure of politicians&amp;rsquo; personal wealth, this paper investigates the role of personal wealth in this process illustrated by the case of the Netherlands. I show that parliaments became significantly less wealthy over time. I then analyze voting behavior of politicians on several laws extending the franchise and increasing taxes.</description>

      <description>Abstract Using newly-collected archival data, this study investigates the wealth and investment portfolio&amp;rsquo;s of Dutch politicians from 1870 to 1922. In a period when the political and economic situation underwent many changes, this study finds that the political arena remains rather static: politicians are wealthy in comparison to the average citizen. Secondly, Upper House members are by far the wealthiest politicians followed by executives. Lower house politicians are the poorest on average, consistent with the lower house being accessible by the entire male population of the country.</description>
