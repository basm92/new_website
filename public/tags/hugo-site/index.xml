      <title>Dynamic Returns to Political Tenure</title>

      <description>Abstract Economists frequently assert that politicians derive financial returns from a political career, but these returns can be obscured by the varying duration of political careers. In this study, I estimate the financial returns associated with successive mandates in the Lower House, capitalizing on the repetitive treatment assignment through close elections in the Netherlands from 1848-1917. Employing a dynamic regression discontinuity framework, I establish that the financial benefits accruing to politicians exhibit a distinct &amp;ldquo;gate-keeping&amp;rdquo; pattern: no financial gains are observed during the first period of political tenure, but substantial returns emerge during the second term.</description>

      <title>Democratization, Personal Wealth of Politicians and Voting Behavior</title>

      <description>Abstract Between about 1850 and 1920, Western Europe underwent a period of democratization and liberalization, resulting in the expansion of government and the establishment of universal suffrage. This paper examines the impact of politicians&amp;rsquo; personal wealth on this process, with a focus on the case of the Netherlands, using data from newly-collected probate inventories as a measure of politicians&amp;rsquo; wealth. The paper finds that the wealth of parliaments decreased significantly over time, and that richer politicians were more likely to vote against fiscal legislation, suggesting that personal wealth negatively influenced the probability of increasing taxes and played a role in determining government size.</description>

      <title>The Wealth of The Dutch Political Elite (1870-1922)</title>

      <description>Abstract Using newly-collected archival data, this study investigates the wealth and investment portfolio&amp;rsquo;s of Dutch politicians from 1870 to 1922. In a period when the political and economic situation underwent many changes, this study finds that the political arena remains rather static: politicians are wealthy in comparison to the average citizen. Secondly, Upper House members are by far the wealthiest politicians followed by executives. Lower house politicians are the poorest on average, consistent with the lower house being accessible by the entire male population of the country.</description>
