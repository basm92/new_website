      <description>Clio is an R package that serves as a bridge between the user and the website Clio Infra, a repository containing publicly available data on various aspects of economic history at the country level. This package is designed to quickly and efficiently extract data, allowing the user to make large queries. This way, the user is not confined to manually downloading Excel files, and the associated filtering and merging process. The package also facilitates transparent and reproducible data collection, and it is ‘typo robust’ to a certain extent, to prevent annoyance.</description>

      <description>Introduction I wanted to write a short post on democratic peace theory to simply explore the correlation between democracy and peace. It is sometimes believed that democratic countries are less likely to wage war on each other than autocratic countries, and furthermore, that democratic countries are less likely to wage war in general (either against autocratic or democratic countries). In this blog post, I want to explore the data to see to which extent this holds true.</description>

      <guid>/blog/2023-02-15-spatial-merging-roman-roads-with-eurostat-data/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this short blog post, I focus on combining several European municipal (LAU, Local Urban Areas) shapefiles, combined with data on roads and cities in the Roman Empire, to find relationships between present-day outcomes and deep-routed interventions as far as more than 2000 years ago.
Let us first load the libraries we need to perform operations.
library(tidyverse) library(giscoR) library(sf) library(cawd) library(regions) For robustness, and out of curiosity, I will use two roads files.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I will demonstrate some useful spatial operations in R. In particular, I want to do some spatial data wrangling to generate a border between two areas on a particular map, and afterwards, compute the distance of each polygon (area) to that border. This is something that is often featured in spatial regression discontinuity designs, where the &amp;ldquo;running&amp;rdquo; variable is the distance (positive or negative) from the border, the border being, for example, ancient borders, an area of exploitation, some territory impacted by some event, or some seized territory.</description>

      <description>Introduction I am doing a couple of assignments involving penalized estimators such as Ridge regression, and I wanted to do a short derivation of its asymptotic covariance. In comparison to the existing resources which I could find, some details are left out, which I wanted to recapitulate more clearly. I&amp;rsquo;ll also contrast the variance of the Ridge estimator to the variance of the OLS estimator, illustrating a fact that also comes to the surface in many other resources, namely that the variance of the Ridge estimator is smaller than that of the OLS estimator.</description>

      <description>Introduction For a course I am teaching in, the syllabus includes an alternative to Principal Component Analysis, called non-negative matrix factorization. The method was introduced in an article by Lee and Seung (1999) with a subsequent elaboration on the algorithm to implement the method in 2001. The method is described in the Elements of Statistical Learning, p. 553, but there is very little elaboration on the meaning and logic behind the updating rule.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I want to work out a couple of games using the concept of Bayesian Nash Equilibria. Bayesian Nash Equilibria are a kind of intermediate step between basic Nash equilibria and Perfect Bayesian Equilibria, which involve multiple stages and require beliefs consistent with Bayes Rules on the equilibrium path.
Bayesian Nash Equilibria are somewhat simpler, and usually involve only one action per type realization, and best responses based on the distribution of type realization of the other players (again conditional on one&amp;rsquo;s own type realization).</description>

      <description>Abstract Economists frequently assert that politicians derive financial returns from a political career, but it is unclear what allows them to do so. In this paper, I derive estimates of the returns to consecutive Lower House mandates exploiting the repeated treatment assignment resulting from Dutch district-level elections (1860-1917). Based on newly-collected data from probate inventories, I obtain a measure of personal wealth for a sample of just-elected politicians and their losing contenders.</description>

      <title>Democratization, Personal Wealth of Politicians and Voting Behavior</title>

      <description>Abstract From about 1850 to 1920, a wave of democratization and liberalization swept over Western Europe, bringing about universal suffrage and an expansion of government. Using newly-collected probate inventories that provide a measure of politicians&amp;rsquo; personal wealth, this paper investigates the role of personal wealth in this process illustrated by the case of the Netherlands. I show that parliaments became significantly less wealthy over time. I then analyze voting behavior of politicians on several laws extending the franchise and increasing taxes.</description>

      <description>Introduction Besley (2004) is a paper about the effects of politicians&amp;rsquo; pay (e.g. wages) on performance. This is a classic issue, tackled firstly by Barro (1973) and Ferejohn (1986), but only recently, the literature has looked into issues surrounding the effect of wages on selection. In the literature, there is a debate about whether higher wages attract better-quality individuals or lesser-quality individuals to the political arena. Besley (2004) is a paper rationalizing the first view.</description>

      <description>Introduction Besley and Case (1995) have a paper about the influence of term limits for politicians on policy behavior. They use a dynamic game. Politicians can serve either 1, or 2, periods, depending on whether they are retained. In these periods, politicians choose to put in effort. Putting in more or less effort is costly to different extents, according to their type. The chosen effort probabilistically affects a policy outcome.</description>

      <description>Introduction I was interviewed by the Dutch economics journal Economisch-Statistische Berichten (ESB) about my PhD work as a part of their new Podcast series on New Economists. In the podcast, I talk about the influence of politicians&amp;rsquo; personal wealth interests on their voting behavior and the many consequences this might have. I also dive into history and give some tangible examples when politicians&amp;rsquo; personal wealth might play a role, and when it might not.</description>

      <title>The Wealth of The Dutch Political Elite (1870-1922)</title>

      <description>Abstract Using newly-collected archival data, this study investigates the wealth and investment portfolio&amp;rsquo;s of Dutch politicians from 1870 to 1922. In a period when the political and economic situation underwent many changes, this study finds that the political arena remains rather static: politicians are wealthy in comparison to the average citizen. Secondly, Upper House members are by far the wealthiest politicians followed by executives. Lower house politicians are the poorest on average, consistent with the lower house being accessible by the entire male population of the country.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this blog post, I wanted to write down an easy implementation of neural networks in Python. The model architecture of neural networks contains three pillars:
The actual model (Multi-layer perceptron network), with inputs, layers, and outputs, and weights connecting these. Forward propagation - the loop from inputs to subsequent layers and finally, the output, using given weights. Backward propagation - updating the weights with gradient descent to minimize the loss.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I want to provide a quick primer about the mathematics underlying the backpropagation algorithm in neural networks and deep learning algorithms. I use the notation provided in this book, chapter 2, and prove/explain in-depth where some of the equations come from. I hope this provides an intuitive and clear explanation about the logic underlying backpropagation, and it should make it easy to implement this using code.</description>

Since the exercises from later chapters are not available online, and since they represent some of the more creative and fun challenges, I just wanted to post a few exercises which I worked out, as well as some (unasked) variations.
Exercise 12.2: Cournot Revisited This exercise asks the following:

      <description>Introduction In this post, I will visualize what the FE-estimator does by benchmarking it to the OLS estimator. I use World Bank data on trade and GDP per capita to estimate (i) a regression equation with OLS, (ii) describing the procedure involved in estimating the FE coefficient and (iii) visualize what that means in this specific setting.

      <description>Introduction I just want to set up a reminder on how to solve for Perfect Bayesian Equilibria (PBE) in the case there might be no pooling or separating equilibria, or in the case there might be additional equilibria next to pooling or separating equilibria. I will do this on the basis of a short game, which is depicted in the figure below, taken from this video. The game is about a &amp;ldquo;terrorist group&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;state&amp;rdquo;, whose interests are, respectively, committing terrorist attacks and preventing/resisting them.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post serves as a reminder and introduction into the usethis package, which provides an interface (and sometimes, a guide) to efficiently working with git from within R. We suppose that git (a version control system) is already installed on your system. The workflow should not vary between operating systems.
Packages like blogdown or hugodown often allow the user to create a folder, with lots of auxilary and supplementary files and an appropriate structure to ensure things work as they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is a small user guide to getting Selenium to work in Python (on a MacOS). In my experience, the Python-Selenium combo works a little bit more smoothly than the R variant. Python seems to be a little bit faster, but the real advantage comes from not having to use Docker: your system will just load a browser (which you can see), and then program, using a for loop, for instance.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this blogpost, I briefly explain how to batch download files in RSelenium. This can be super useful if you want to download some pdf&amp;rsquo;s or other files, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to click &amp;lsquo;download&amp;rsquo; a 1000 times, and there is no other option available.
Step 1: Setting up a Docker Container In this case, we have to deviate from the standard case of setting up a Docker container.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this blogpost, I want to tell you about web scraping using RSelenium, something which I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been learning and which I am very enthusiastic about, because it is very powerful. I want to do this in the context of an example. I have been supervising undergraduate students, and a group of students asked me where they could get a list of members of the Iranian parliament. So I went to the official English-language website of the Iranian parliament, and looked up the list of members.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, I wrote a small pamphlet called ‘R vs. Excel: A quick comparison’ aimed at former or current Excel users to convince them to take up R, and leave aside Microsoft Excel entirely. I think the pamphlet contains some good arguments, so you can read about it here.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is the first blog post on my own website. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make this website using the R package blogdown. The website looks very nice now (in my humble opinion), but it was tedious to make. When attempting to create the website, I first tried out a couple of themes before I settled on the basic &amp;ldquo;lithium&amp;rdquo; theme, because it was by far the easiest theme to wrap your head around.</description>

      <title>R: filtering with across in dplyr</title>

      <guid>/blog/2022-08-02-r-filtering-with-across-in-dplyr/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The newest versions of the dplyr package introduced a new function, across(), to be used within summarise, mutate and filter functions, and I am trying to learn it. I am, however, having a hard time understanding the use and the mechanics of the function in combination with filter. While this vignette has ample examples on mutate and summarise, the examples on filter are few and not very insightful. The same is true for several non-official guides that I have read.</description>
